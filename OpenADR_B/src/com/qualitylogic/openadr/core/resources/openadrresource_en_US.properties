Prompt_047=Prompt_047: Note that the test harness will wait unil it receives two periodic telemetry reports. The first report will arrive in approximately 1 minute and the second report 2 minutes following the first. Please press Resume to continue.
Prompt_048=Prompt_048: As both sides of this test case can be in initiator of error conditions, one side must claim to be testing a real device and the other side claim to be doing a self test.
Prompt_049=Prompt_049: Cause the VEN to initiate a re-registration while already in a registered state.
Prompt_050=Prompt_050: Press YES if testing real device, NO if running self test. Note that this test case when run in self test mode requires you answer this prompt YES from one side of the exchange (VEN or VTN )and NO for the other side of the exchange.
Prompt_051=Prompt_051: Cause the VEN to republish its metadata report.
Prompt_052=Prompt_052: Cause the VTN to republish its metadata report.
Prompt_053=Prompt_053: This is an optional test case. If the  DUT VEN  does not support HISTORY_USAGE reports, the test case may be skipped. Note that Report Only VENs must support this report.
Prompt_054=Prompt_054: A Delay of appoximatly 2 minutes should occur before the first report is delivered in an oadrUpdateReport Payload. Please answer Yes if there was a delay in transmission of the oadrUpdateReport payload, no if the payload was delivered immediately.
Prompt_055=Prompt_055: Configure the VTN DUT such that it will send a report request as follows:\n\n-TELEMETRY_STATUS Report\n-Granularity = PT0M (on change)\n-reportBackDuration = PT1M\n-reportInterval:dtstart = CurrentTime + 2 minute\n-reportInterval:duration = 5 minutes\n
Prompt_056=Prompt_056: Configure the VTN DUT such that it will send a report request as follows:\n\n-TELEMETRY_STATUS Report\n-granularity = 1 minute \n-reportBackDuration = granularity\n-reportInterval:dtstart = CurrentTime\n-reportInterval:duration = 0 minutes\n
Prompt_057=Prompt_057: Configure the VTN DUT such that it will send a report cancellation request with reporToFollow set to true.
Prompt_058=Prompt_058: Configure the VTN DUT such that it will send a two report request as follows:\n\n-TELEMETRY_STATUS Report\n-Granularity = PT0M - will be Ignored\n-reportBackDuration = PT0M\n-Do not include report Interval as this is a one shot report\n\nTELEMETRY_USAGE Report\n-granularity = minimum sampling rate\n-reportBackDuration = PT0M\n-Do not include report Interval as this is a one shot report\n-rID values for powerReal and energyReal\n
Prompt_059=Prompt_059: This test case is for self test only and should not be run against the DUT.
Prompt_060=Prompt_060: The VEN should issue 2 reports, one immediately and another in 1 minute. The text case will continue to run for approximately 3 minutes after pressing Resume.
Prompt_061=Prompt_061: The test case sends a payload to the DUT, but expects no response. If running in self test, only one side of the conversation can initiate the attempt to send a payload. Press Yes if testing a real device or initiating the payload in Self Test, otherwise answer No.
Prompt_062=Prompt_062: B profile VTN must support concurrent interoperation with A and B profile VENs. Please configure the A and B test harness such that they can communicate with VTN using non-conflicting VEN ID's and one of the supported transports and exchange models (push or pull) on each test harness. Run the registration test case on the B profile test harness (Nx0020_TH_VEN). Then alternately run 2 randomly selected test cases from each test harness on the device under test. Answer this prompt Yes if the alternately run  test cases passed without needing to configure the DUT VTN between executions, Answer No if any test cases failed or configuration was required when switching execution between test harnesses.
Prompt_063=Prompt_063: 
Prompt_064=Prompt_064: Configure the VTN DUT such that it will send a report request as follows:\n\n-TELEMETRY_STATUS Report\n-Granularity = PT1M  \n-reportBackDuration = PT1M\n-reportInterval:dtstart = CurrentTime\n-reportInterval:duration = 2 minutes\n
Prompt_065=Prompt_065: The VTN DUT should be configured so that there is a single pending event configured as follows:\n\ndtstart = CurrentTime + 1 minutes, duration = 5 minutes\nSIMPLE, signalType = level\nInterval #1, 5 minutes, signalPayload = 2\nClick resume when event has been added to the VTN.
